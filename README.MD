## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wrote the html and css first to get a suitable game board built from buttons using flex. 


## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
